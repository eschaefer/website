I haven't thought about favicons in years, but I read an interesting article this morning called [How to Favicon in 2022:
Six files that fit most needs](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs). It was written by Andrey Sitnik, creator of PostCSS and Autoprefixer, so the article has my attention.

The tldr is this is all you need in modern browsers:

```html
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" sizes="any" /><!-- 32×32 -->
<link rel="icon" href="/icon.svg" type="image/svg+xml" />
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/apple-touch-icon.png" /><!-- 180×180 -->
<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.webmanifest" />
```

And in your `manifest.webmanifest` file:

```json
{
  "icons": [
    { "src": "/icon-192.png", "type": "image/png", "sizes": "192x192" },
    { "src": "/icon-512.png", "type": "image/png", "sizes": "512x512" }
  ]
}
```
