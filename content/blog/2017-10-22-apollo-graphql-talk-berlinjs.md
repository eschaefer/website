Today I gave my first talk at BerlinJS! I started with some gripes that I have
with building imperative-style user interfaces, and gave some examples of how
declarative UIs are simpler to maintain. I wrapped-up with an example React app
that I built with Apollo and GraphQL, and demonstrated how we can get selective
server-side rendering and all kinds of smart performance improvements with this
toolset.

I also open-sourced the boilerplate that I built for this talk, so check it out
if you want a starting-point for your next app that needs a more declarative
approach to fetching data:
