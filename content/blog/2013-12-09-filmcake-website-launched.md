Another successful launch in collaboration with the rad [Sunst-Studio](http://sunst-studio.com/) design team in Berlin. The [Filmcake](http://about.filmcake.com) website is fully responsive and was built on Wordpress, using the [Bones](http://themble.com/bones/) base theme, which I found incredibly flexible, and comes with minimal Javascript weight. Additionally it comes with both LESS and SASS starting points (choose your poison) baked-in for rapid styling and development.

This was a very straightforward project with no technical hurdles, and raw development time was probably only two weeks.
