At long last, the minds behind [Tech Open Air Berlin](http://toaberlin.com) have launched a sister company called [Openers](http://www.opnrs.com). The primary goal of the website is to showcase their portfolio and strengths in consulting, media, events, branding and strategy.

The design was done by long-time collaborators [Sunst-Studio](http://sunst-studio.com/), and I built-out the backend in Wordpress. Easy management of portfolio galleries, and flexibility to move content around made Wordpress a solid choice.

Go hire these folks if you want the best-connected strategists in Berlin!
