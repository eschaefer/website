![Axel Pfaender's web store](/images/posts/axel-web-store.png)

In an unlikely turn of events, I took on a Wordpress project this month as well. Take one look at this guy's stuff and you'll know why. Behold [Axel Pfaender's web store](http://shop.axelpfaender.com/). I had to make some significant changes to Shopp's core and UI files to make it play nicely with Germany's value-added-tax laws. The same would apply to a number of other EU countries as well. Anyway, the site is also multilingual, and I learned a lot about how internationalization works on the back end. Cool stuff. I'm just fantasizing about porting this whole thing to Rails though...
