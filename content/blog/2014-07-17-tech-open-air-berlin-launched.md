In collaboration with [Avalon Emerson](http://avalonemerson.com), and with record time constraints, we built the 2014 edition of the [Tech Open Air Berlin](http://toaberlin.com) website. Once again I chose Wordpress to bolster easy content administration for the small team of event organizers. A number of custom content types, and lots of metadeta about events required building some custom plugins. More integration with Eventbrite would have been nice to dig into, but we simply didn't have the time to go that far.
