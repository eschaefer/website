For real? This nifty Apache module just jumped out of beta, and an nginx version is available as well. Over 40 output filters that range from CSS rewriting to image manipulation and preprocessing. [Google's Ilya Grigorik has a great writeup on it here](http://www.igvita.com/2012/10/10/automating-web-performance-with-mod_pagespeed/).
