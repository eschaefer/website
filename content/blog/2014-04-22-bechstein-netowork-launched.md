Yet another launch in collaboration with the ever-badass [Sunst-Studio](http://sunst-studio.com/) design team in Berlin. The brand new [Bechstein Network](http://www.bechstein-network.com) website is built on Wordpress, which provides a familiar backend for the network members. Easy posting was paramount for this project, so members (galleries, clubs, restaurants, architects, etc) can quickly showcase events and work.

A customized filtering system was built to find network members based on categories, and network member profile pages have a flexible back-end that allows members to highlight their strengths and showcase detailed photos of their work.

This is also the first project I used [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) for a build process in both development and production environments.
