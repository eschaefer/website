Since May 2013 I've been working with the insanely talented designers and developers at [King Design](http://kingdesignllc.com). My time there has been pretty nuts; lots of client work, jumping into projects that have been brewing for many months.

I'm proud to say my first complete front-end build with King Design is also my first [ExpressionEngine](http://ellislab.com/expressionengine) build. And I have to admit, ExpressionEngine rules. After a brief learning curve, I found the templating engine a breeze to work with. I still have a lot to learn, and I've only scratched the surface of what's under the hood in EE.

This particular project took a little under two months to code, which included a few iterations of functionality and design. More updates are on the way for this one too. I'm really looking forward to another ExpressionEngine project now!
