> Imagine an environment not as an ambience but rather as a complex ecology where each part is equally responsive and responsible in its own becoming. Key to this responsiveness is the awareness of inside and outside collapsing in the realization that each element is embedded in a constellation whose patterns exceed that of any single component.
>
> We are embedded in our own affect.
