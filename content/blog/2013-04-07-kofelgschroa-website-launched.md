![Kofelgschroa's front page](/images/posts/kofelgschroa-website.jpg)

[Kofelgschroa's website](http://kofelgschroa.by) is a collaboration project with the mega-talented designers at Berlin's [Sunst-Studio](http://sunst-studio.com/). I'll be working with them again on some other projects, so definitely looking forward to that. Swear to god, working with designers makes the development process so much smoother.

The website is built on Drupal with a totally custom Zen-based theme. I also made good use of [Isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co) for sorting and filtering the blog posts page in an elegant way that works on all browsers. Additionally, I'm finding that parts of Twitter's Bootstrap framework are insanely useful. I'm starting to think of Bootstrap as a collection of small front-end tools that can be plucked out rather than a static framework.
