![Maximinimal work studio](/images/posts/home-office.JPG)

I'm finally settled in my new apartment in Neuk√∂lln, and rent is cheap enough here to afford extra space for a studio. So voila, here's the minimalist studio where I'll be working, with the only (welcome) distractions coming from the backgammon players at the shisha bar downstairs. The windows will remain permanently open until the rainy days of fall force me to close them.

In the meantime I will be neck-deep in some new Ruby on Rails adventures, and beginning a [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun) course to keep me on my toes.
