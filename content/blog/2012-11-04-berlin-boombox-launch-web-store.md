![Berlin Boombox website](/images/posts/berlin-boombox.jpg)

Today I wrapped up the official website for the [Berlin Boombox](http://www.berlinboombox.com/), which is a badass DIY soundsystem developed by Berlin designer [Axel Pfaender](http://www.axelpfaender.com/). The site includes a lot of cool stuff, and some of the best-designed instructions ever. Since the website didn't really need any special app-like functionality, I built it on Drupal with a custom [Zen](http://drupal.org/project/zen)-based sub theme. Coming soon will be an interactive Google Maps mashup on the "Buy" page, which will give a nice overview of the retail locations. Can't wait to see Axel's design ideas on that.
