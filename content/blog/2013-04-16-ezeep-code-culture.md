<a href="http://youtu.be/uMc4RnEmHLc?t=4m18s">![Google Hangout with ezeep](/images/posts/ezeep-code-culture-hangout.png)</a>

Yesterday I participated in a discussion that Berlin-based startup [ezeep](https://www.ezeep.com/) hosted, in which we discussed the various cultures around programming languages, and how those cultures shape the real-life projects we work on. The topic stemmed from ezeep's recent decision to [rewrite their backend in Python](http://blog.ezeep.com/why-java-sucks-for-ezeep).

Something that Marian Zange mentioned struck me as the real meat of this discussion:

> ...even if you join our team through a marketing or sales route, youâ€™ll get an engineering intro (the happy, smiling 'light edition') to explore parts of our code, learn how to read it and understand the inner-workings of our product.

This kind of intro for non-technical participants to a project's codebase was once unheard of. It's symptomatic of a larger trend in programming--I believe--that communication with those outside the walls of the programming community is essential to evolving a project, and more broadly, evolving how languages are structured. The culture around languages like Python and Ruby are certainly making coding more accessible to anyone interested. Free online tools like [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com) seem to have caught on like wildfire, and in the long term, will simply make people smarter and more well-rounded problem solvers. And as long as companies like ezeep take the time to explain the inner-workings of their product to their employees, we might see less of a dividing line between the technical and "non-technical" camps among people that have a common interest in technology.
